# Simon-Game
This is a Simon Game assignment I completed with the Complete 2019  Web Development Bootcamp Udemy Course. I created the game's functionality (I'm responsible for all the code in game.js file) as well as the background. I used Javascript and JQuery to create the game. I styled the background as well. The images as well as the rest of the CSS was provided by the course.
